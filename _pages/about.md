I am Bin Huang, an incoming Research Associate at Case Western Reserve University, where I will be advised by Prof. Shuo Li.

I received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Biomedical Engineering from Shenzhen University. During my doctoral studies, I was very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Bingsheng Huang and Prof. Xin Chen (Dean).

My research interests focus on medical image processing. I am particularly interested in tackling challenges related to model generalization, interpretability, and causal inference in medical AI. My research also involves novel imaging modalities, such as magneto-acousto-electrical tomography (MAET).

I have published over ten first-author papers in top-tier journals, including IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI) and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI), and at leading international conferences like MICCAI.

I also actively serve the academic community as a reviewer for international journals, including Nature Communications, Medical Physics, and iScience.
